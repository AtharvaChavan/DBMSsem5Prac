Normalization is the process of MINIMIZING REDUNDANCY from a relation or set of relations.

Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations.
Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.

SPECIALIZATION is reverse of generalization
Top-to-bottom
